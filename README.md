**Advanced To-Do List**

This is an advanced To-Do List application built with Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to add, edit, delete, mark tasks as completed, and clear the entire task list. The tasks are saved in a tasks.json file to persist even when the application is closed.

**Features**
1. Add Task: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
2. Edit Task: Lets the user edit an existing task.
3. Delete Task: Allows the user to delete a selected task.
4. Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed with a checkmark (âœ”).
5. Clear All Tasks: Clears all tasks from the list.
6. Persistence: Tasks are saved in a tasks.json file, so they are restored when the application is restarted.
   
**Requirements**
1. Python 3.x
2. Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
3. JSON (used for saving and loading tasks)
